## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language . It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites â€” all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript.
